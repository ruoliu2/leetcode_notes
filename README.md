# My Leetcode Solutions & Notes

> This repo hosts the solutions & notes for the problems I've solved on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/). Hopefully it will be useful to others as well.

<br/>

Solutions from these languages will be in Python. Some solutions come from [neetcode.io](https://www.neetcode.io/). Shout out to Mr. Neetcode for his awesome work! Some other come from variation of solutions posted on leetcode discussion board.

The code documented in this repo is for the most intuitive, memorizable, and extensible solutions. Some of the techniques used could be easily reused and apply to many other problems. Hence I organized them as notes in this repo.

The notes are still under construction. The topics to add in consideration are:

- [ ] Sliding Window
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Two Pointers
- [ ] Intervals
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Trie/Compressed Trie
- [ ] More DP!
- [ ] Hash

<br/>

Lmk if you found an error in the template code or the notes.

## Happy leeting!
